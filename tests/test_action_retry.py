"""Tests for the action retry/backoff logic and diagnostic sensors.

Tests cover:
- Charger commands are retried automatically when they fail, with increasing delays
- Charger responds normally after transient communication errors
- Failure is reported only after all automatic retry attempts are exhausted
- Error indicators disappear and failure alerts clear when charger commands succeed again
- Diagnostic dashboard shows error details and timing for debugging charger issues
