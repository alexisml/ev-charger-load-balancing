    since the charger is at 0 A, *not* ``"ramp_up_hold"`` which only occurs
    when the charger is running and an increase is blocked).  A second spike
    while still in the hold period resets the cooldown timer (available headroom
    decreased from above min to below it), extending the hold period.  Final
    recovery only happens after the cooldown expires from the *last* spike.
