### Key design decisions

- **Pure computation functions** (`load_balancer.py`) have no dependency on Home Assistant. They can be tested with plain pytest.
- **Coordinator pattern** (`coordinator.py`) — the coordinator subscribes to power-meter events and orchestrates the balancing loop. Entity platforms subscribe to dispatcher signals.
- **Action scripts** — the integration doesn't talk to chargers directly. Users configure HA scripts that translate commands to their specific charger hardware. This keeps the integration hardware-agnostic.
- **Single instance** — currently enforced via `async_set_unique_id(DOMAIN)`. Multi-charger support is planned for Phase 2.

For more on why a custom integration was chosen over AppDaemon or blueprints, see [`docs/development-memories/2026-02-19-lessons-learned.md`](../development-memories/2026-02-19-lessons-learned.md).

## Setting up a development environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- pip (or your preferred Python package manager)

### Install dependencies

```bash
# From the repository root
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

This installs `pytest`, `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`, and related packages.

---

## Running tests

### All tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Pure-logic unit tests only (fastest — no HA dependency)

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_load_balancer.py -v
```

These 39 tests cover the core computation functions: available current calculation, clamping, water-filling distribution, and ramp-up cooldown. They run in under 1 second.

### Config flow and integration tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_config_flow.py tests/test_init.py -v
```

These use `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` to simulate the HA config flow UI and entry setup/unload.

### Logging tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_logging.py -v
```

### Service tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_set_limit_service.py -v
```

## Running CI checks locally

The repository has several CI checks that run on every PR. Here's how to run them locally:

### Linting (Ruff)

```bash
pip install ruff
ruff check .
```

Ruff reads its configuration from `pyproject.toml`.

### Type checking (Pyright)

```bash
pip install pyright
pyright
```

Pyright reads its configuration from `pyrightconfig.json`.

### Spell checking (codespell)

```bash
pip install codespell
codespell
```

Codespell reads its configuration from `pyproject.toml`.

### Secret scanning (Gitleaks)

```bash
# macOS
brew install gitleaks
# or download from https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases

gitleaks detect --source . --config .gitleaks.toml
```

To suppress a confirmed false positive, append `# gitleaks:allow` to that line. For path-level suppressions, add the path regex to `.gitleaks.toml`.

### Dependency Review

This check is GitHub-only and runs automatically on every pull request — no local tooling required.

## Contributing

### Code contributions

1. Fork the repository and create a branch.
2. Make your changes with tests.
3. Run the full test suite: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
4. Run lint, type check, and spell check (see above).
5. Open a PR against the `main` branch.

### Documentation contributions

- All research, plans, and design docs go under `docs/development-memories/` with an ISO-date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-name.md`.
- User-facing docs go under `docs/documentation/`.
- Every PR should include a development memory file documenting the work done.

See [`docs/development-memories/README.md`](../development-memories/README.md) for the full convention.

### Code style

- **Ruff** enforces linting and formatting (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
- **Pyright** enforces type safety (configured in `pyrightconfig.json`).
- Named constants live in `const.py` — avoid magic numbers and strings.
- Functions should have docstrings explaining their purpose.
- Test docstrings describe observable user behavior, not implementation details.

| Milestone | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PR-1 | Integration scaffold + Config Flow | ✅ Done |
| PR-2 | Core entities and device linking | ✅ Done |
| PR-3 | Single-charger balancing engine | ✅ Done |
| PR-4 | Action execution contract | ✅ Done |
| PR-5-MVP | Event notifications | ✅ Done |
| PR-6-MVP | Manual override + observability | ✅ Done |
| PR-7-MVP | Test stabilization + HACS release readiness | ✅ Done |
| PR-8-MVP | User manual | ✅ Done |

See the full plan: [`docs/documentation/milestones/01-2026-02-19-mvp-plan.md`](milestones/01-2026-02-19-mvp-plan.md)

### Phase 2 — Multi-charger (planned)

Multi-charger support with per-charger prioritization and weighted current distribution.

| Milestone | Scope |
|---|---|
| PR-1-ph2 | Multi-charger data model |
| PR-2-ph2 | Weighted current distribution engine |
| PR-3-ph2 | Runtime charger management |
| PR-4-ph2 | Test stabilization + release |
