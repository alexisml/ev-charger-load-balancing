# EV Charger Load Balancing (HACS)

A custom Home Assistant integration (HACS) that provides dynamic load balancing for EV chargers, using a power meter and the lbbrhzn/ocpp integration.

This project gives Home Assistant users a native, no-helper-required solution to limit charging current to an EV charger based on a whole-home power meter, household limits, and user preferences.

> ⚠️ **Current limitation (PR-1):** This integration currently supports **one charger per instance**. Multiple-charger support (water-filling fair distribution) is planned for a future PR. Multiple instances of this integration are not supported — only one config entry can be created. See the [roadmap](docs/development/2026-02-19-research-plan.md) for details.

Status: In development — custom integration (PR-1: scaffold + Config Flow complete)

## Why a custom integration?

During prototyping we evaluated AppDaemon apps and automation blueprints as potential delivery mechanisms. Both were rejected for the same reason: **every runtime-configurable parameter (service current, voltage, charger limits, enable toggle) must be a manually created `input_number` / `input_boolean` helper** because neither AppDaemon nor blueprints can create Config Entries in HA.

A **custom HACS integration with Config Flow** solves this:

- **No manual helper creation** — the user configures everything through Settings → Integrations → Add (a guided UI).
- **Native HA entities** — the integration registers `number`, `switch`, `sensor`, and `binary_sensor` entities linked to a proper device in Settings → Devices.
- **Persistent state** — config entries and entity states survive HA restarts.
- **Multi-charger support** *(planned)* — future options flow will handle adding/removing chargers at runtime; currently one charger per instance only.
- **HACS distribution** — install via HACS, configure in the UI, no YAML required.

See [`docs/development/2026-02-19-lessons-learned.md`](docs/development/2026-02-19-lessons-learned.md) for the full evaluation.

## How it works

### Inputs

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| **Service voltage** (V) | Nominal supply voltage — used to convert power (W) ↔ current (A) |
| **Service current** (A) | Maximum whole-house breaker rating; the system never exceeds this |
| **Power meter** (W) | Real-time total household consumption, including active EV charging |
| **Max charger current** (A) | Per-charger upper limit; can be changed at runtime |
| **Min EV current** (A) | Lowest current at which the charger can operate (IEC 61851: 6 A); below this charging must stop |
| **Ramp-up time** (s) | Cooldown before allowing current to increase after a dynamic reduction (default 30 s) |
| **Actions** | User-supplied scripts: `set_current`, `stop_charging`, `start_charging` |

### Decision loop

Every time the power meter reports a new value, the balancer runs the following logic:

```

         └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘ ramp-up elapsed ┘
              start_charging()  then  set_current(target_a)
```

Key rules:
- **Reductions are always instant** — the moment household load rises above the limit, the charger current is reduced on the very next power-meter event.
- **Increases are held for `ramp_up_time_s`** after any reduction — this prevents rapid oscillation when load hovers near the service limit.
- **Stopping charging** happens when even the minimum current would exceed the service limit.
- **Resuming charging** happens when the available current rises back above the minimum threshold and the ramp-up cooldown has elapsed.

### Multi-charger fairness — planned feature

> ⚠️ **Not yet implemented.** Multi-charger support is planned for a future PR (PR-5/PR-6). The water-filling algorithm is already unit-tested in `tests/test_load_balancer.py` and will be ported into the integration runtime. Possible future approaches include multiple config entries (one per power meter / site) or a single entry with an options flow to add/remove chargers.

When multiple chargers are active the available current will be distributed fairly using a water-filling algorithm:

```
Available current pool
────────────────────────────────────────────
   Charger A (max 10 A)  │  Charger B (max 32 A)
   ───────────────────── │  ──────────────────────
   fair share = pool / N │  fair share = pool / N
                         │
   if share ≥ max A      │  gets share
   → cap at 10 A         │
   → unused headroom     │
     returned to pool    │
────────────────────────────────────────────
   Remaining pool re-divided across uncapped chargers
```

1. Divide the pool equally among all active chargers.
2. Chargers that reach their per-charger maximum are capped; the surplus is returned to the pool.
3. Chargers whose share would fall below `min_ev_a` are stopped; they leave the pool.
4. Repeat until all remaining chargers have a valid fair share.
