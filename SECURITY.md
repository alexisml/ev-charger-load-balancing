## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report security vulnerabilities using [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/alexisml/ha-ev-charger-balancer/security/advisories/new). This keeps the disclosure private until a fix is available.

Include:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept (if safe to share)
- Any suggested mitigations you are aware of

You will receive an acknowledgement within **7 days**. If the vulnerability is confirmed, a fix will be prioritized and a public advisory published after the patch is released.

## Scope

This integration is a **software load balancer** that adjusts EV charger current via Home Assistant. It is not a replacement for electrical protection hardware (breakers, fuses, RCDs). Security issues in scope include:

- Unauthorized control of charger settings (e.g. bypassing manual override)
- Sensitive data exposure through logs or events
- Dependency vulnerabilities in packages listed in `tests/requirements.txt` or `custom_components/ev_lb/manifest.json`

Issues related to the Home Assistant platform itself or third-party charger hardware are out of scope — please report those to the relevant upstream projects.

## Disclosure policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** model:

1. Reporter submits a private vulnerability report.
2. Maintainer acknowledges within 7 days.
3. Fix is developed and tested privately.
4. Fix is released; a public GitHub Security Advisory is published.
5. Reporter is credited in the advisory (unless they prefer to remain anonymous).

## AI disclosure

Parts of this project were developed with AI assistance. If you identify a vulnerability that appears to be a class of error commonly introduced by AI-generated code (e.g. improper input validation, insecure defaults), please report it so patterns can be identified and corrected.
