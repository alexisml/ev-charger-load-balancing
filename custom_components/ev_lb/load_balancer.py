"""Pure computation functions for EV charger dynamic load balancing.

This module contains the core balancing logic used by the integration
runtime.  It has no dependency on Home Assistant — it can be tested
with plain pytest.

Functions:
    compute_available_current   — max EV current given a non-EV power draw
    compute_target_current      — full single-charger target from service meter (amps)
    clamp_current               — per-charger min/max/step clamping
    distribute_current          — water-filling distribution across N chargers
    apply_ramp_up_limit         — cooldown before allowing current increase
    clamp_to_safe_output        — defense-in-depth output safety clamp
    resolve_balancer_state      — operational state string from balancer conditions
    resolve_fallback_current    — fallback current when power meter is unavailable
    compute_fallback_reapply    — adjusted fallback after charger parameter changes
