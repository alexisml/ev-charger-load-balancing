set_limit:
  name: Set charging limit
  description: >-
    Manually override the charger current limit. The value is clamped to the
    charger's min/max range. If it falls below the minimum EV current, charging
    is stopped. The override is one-shot — the next power-meter event resumes
    automatic balancing. When multiple instances are configured, provide
    entry_id to target a specific instance; omit it to apply to all instances.
